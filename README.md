# Motivation  

Blockchain has been growing rapidly since its inception. The widespread adoption of blockchain technology has resulted in a diverse and heterogeneous ecosystem, with a wide range of use cases and applications. Therefore, due to the popularity of blockchain, there has been a significant increase in inter-chain communication demands, especially the atomicity of data transfer.  

When it comes to cross-chain transactions, atomicity is very important. Any inconsistency or failure in a single transaction can cause failure in the entire cross-chain business process involving multiple blockchain. Ensuring the atomicity of cross-chain business guarantees that all transactions within the business are either completed successfully, or rolled back to their previous state. And ensuing atomicity in the cross-chain context is a challenging work.

# Our Solution 

We aim to solve this challenge in this project. This is a prototype of our solution, named SA-Xchain, which is a script-based directed acyclic graph generation for atomic cross-chain data operation. Our solution can guarantee the atomicity of cross-chain data transfer, as well as simplify cross-chain business development. This solution can be used for atomic and consistent data transfer, serving as middleware across multiple heterogeneous blockchain networks.
